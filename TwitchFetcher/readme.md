Prerequisites

* BeautifulSoup
* Simple-term-menu

Will fetch streams from e.g. "league-of-legends" and display them, alternatively you can also search for a specific streamer. The resulting stream will be piped into streamlink, which will open, if installed, the stream in VLC.

Offers simple UI, where the user can select and search for streams.

To run the application: python main.py
